This is an overview of some noteworthy projects that I am working on.

# Seaside

Seaside is intended to be a modern, lightweight and fast IDE for the C programming language, centered around the Clang/LLVM toolchain. Over the years, I have become increasingly frustrated with the state of modern software development tools. I have witnessed how the development environments that I was using on a regular basis have become slower and buggier with every update. My hope is that I can do my share in fixing this problem by creating a properly integrated development environment for C that gets out of the way and is a joy to use.

# Stevie's Blog

I started this blog in January 2025, hoping to create a beautiful homepage for myself and a writing outlet for some of my ideas. So far, so good.
